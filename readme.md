# Flysystem Adapter Tests

I am testing a couple of different Flysystem Adapters (Main AWS S3 V3).

## TLDR;

After cloning this repo, do these steps:

```
# You will need to fill in .env with your settings.
cp env.sample .env

# Leave it alone, or tweak it to suit you
cp example.phpunit.xml phpunit.xml

composer update
phpunit

```

## Under construction

I am testing AWS S3 V3, so I am mostly testing that. I will fill this out more when I have time to test others.
